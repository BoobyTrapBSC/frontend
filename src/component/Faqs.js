So, this team has taken the onus on themselves to come up with a platform where you will get all the legit DEVS (with KYC), list of their successful projects and also upcoming ones with jaw dropping details, doxxed Influencers and service providers at one platform. Investors will be able to rate the projects, Devs, Service Providers, Influencers & promoters with 'TRAP Points' from 0-10, with 0 trap points meaning extremely safe, 1-2 being safe, 3-5 being moderate, and 5-9 being dangerous, and 10 being extremely dangerous. The rating ecosystem will be built on blockchain, thus being immutable and transparent.

                            It is high time that we trap and kill the scammers and fraudsters running amok in DeFi space. BoobyTrap has a dictionary definition as “a trap intended as a practical joke, especially one involving an object placed on top of a door ajar ready to fall on a person passing through”. The idea did come from a joke our owner shared with his friend over a drink but took a serious shape as there is enough realisation that the DeFi space is filled with scammers and fraudsters and it is high time something was done about it. We intend on being the 911 of DeFi space and those in stress can give us a shout out. $BBT ecosystem will be building an extensive trap for scammers and fraudsters over the period of its development and a safe haven for investors, thus making the DeFi space a safer place.

They will be listed on the platform after KYC and ticking our listing parameters which will make them eligible for a rating system. On the basis of the ratings one can contact a dev, influencer/promoter or service provider according to their requirements and investors can invest in their projects on the basis of the ratings which will keep them away from the scams.

We will also be coming up with Investor Education Programmes (IEP) on our platform which include videos, articles and AMA sessions on how to invest safely in DEFI space. We are targeting building a strong community by providing them a safer place and also educating them to turn them from an average ape into a smart investor.

                        Most of the supply is allocated for Presale and Launch i.e. 79%, and the private sale tokens i.e. 10.5% will be vested in three blocks (40% at launch and rest 60% in two batches one after two weeks of launch and another after four weeks of launch). Team tokens i.e. 7.5% are also vested over a period of six months from launch. This ensures that at launch no one will be holding any substantial amount and hence prevent dumping. In Fact the most a single wallet can hold at launch is ~$1200, that too from presale.

                            After launch we promote free and fair trading and hence will have a 2% max wallet limit. Whales are a necessary evil for the volume and growth of any token and we want to promote whale entries as well as protect our small investors from the manipulations.

In order to accommodate our grand vision, we had to decide to migrate to a newer contract and take this project to the entire DeFi space and make it known to everyone trying to make a safer and better DeFi.
